# Welcome!

I am Ashlee Patacsil-Hardin, a Master's student studying Ecosystem Science and Sustainability with a concentration in Carbon Management. Throughout my education, I have dedicated myself to climate change, carbon management, and sustainability. On this website, I offer a glimpse into my resume, current and past classes, and ongoing interests.

My interests span different academic disciplines, from entomology to data science. I am particularly passionate about being outdoors and learning. Additionally, I have been involved in important climate change conferences (Conference of the Parties 27)

Not only am I a scholar, but I am also a Graduate Teaching Assistant. Over the past year, I have had the honor and opportunity to work with over 200+ undergraduate students, passing on my knowledge and expertise to the next generation.

Please feel free to [contact me](mailto:ajphardin33@gmail.com) through email if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects.
